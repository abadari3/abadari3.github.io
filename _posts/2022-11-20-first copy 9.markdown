Hello, I'm Srivathsan Nayak, and I have no idea what I'm doing.

This is my first blog post, and I just wanted to check if everything is working properly or not.

If you can read this, that means it works!

$$\varphi_X(t) = \mathbb{E}\left[e^{tX}\right]$$

Hopefully I will *actually* post something here $\sin(x)$, later :)
