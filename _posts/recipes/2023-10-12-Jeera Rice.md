| 9. Cover the pan partially and let the rice simmer.  |  A side shot of the pan partially covered with a lid, allowing viewers to see the level to which it should be covered. |
| 10. Once the majority of the water has been absorbed and the rice looks mostly cooked, cover the pan fully and let it cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. | A close-up of the pan fully covered, capturing the steam starting to escape from the edges. |
| 11. Turn off the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 5-10 minutes to allow any excess water to be reabsorbed. Fluff with a fork and serve warm. | An overhead shot of the perfectly cooked rice after being fluffed with a fork, ideally in a beautiful serving bowl or plate.|
