Vice is a political drama film that was released in 2018 and directed by Adam McKay. The film stars Christian Bale as Dick Cheney, the former Vice President of the United States, and chronicles his rise to power and influence in the political world. The film also stars Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney, Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, and Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, among others.

One of the film's strengths is its compelling and well-acted portrayal of Dick Cheney's rise to power. Christian Bale gives a standout performance as Cheney, capturing the former Vice President's physical mannerisms and speech patterns with great precision. The film also does a good job of portraying the various political and historical events that shaped Cheney's career, such as the Watergate scandal, the Vietnam War, and the September 11th attacks. These elements give the film a sense of authenticity and depth, and they help to make it more engaging and informative.

One of the main themes of Vice is the rise of Dick Cheney to power and influence in the political world. Cheney served as the Vice President of the United States under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009, and he played a significant role in shaping the policies of the Bush Administration. Prior to his time as Vice President, Cheney had a long and distinguished career in politics, serving as the White House Chief of Staff under President Gerald Ford, the Representative for Wyoming's at-large congressional district, and the CEO of Halliburton, among other positions.

During his time as Vice President, Cheney was known for his strong influence on foreign and domestic policy, and he played a key role in shaping the Bush Administration's response to the September 11th attacks and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was also known for his strong support of the Bush Administration's controversial policies, such as the Patriot Act, enhanced interrogation techniques, and the invasion of Iraq. These policies and decisions have been the subject of much debate and controversy, and they have had significant consequences for the United States and the world.

In addition to its portrayal of Cheney's career, Vice also explores the broader theme of power and influence in the political world. The film examines the ways in which politicians, lobbyists, and other powerful figures can shape and influence policy and public opinion, and it highlights the complex and often shadowy world of politics. The film's portrayal of these themes is thought-provoking and timely, and it is likely to resonate with audiences who are interested in politics and current events. Overall, the historical context of Vice adds depth and complexity to the film, and it helps to make it more engaging and relevant.

However, despite its strong acting and historical context, Vice is a film that is ultimately flawed in its execution. One of the main issues with the film is its heavy-handed and preachy tone, as it often feels more like an anti-Cheney propaganda piece than a balanced and objective portrayal of his career. The film's portrayal of Cheney as a power-hungry and ruthless politician is one-dimensional and oversimplified, and it fails to take into account the complexity and nuance of his political career. This heavy-handed tone detracts from rather than enhances the film, as it often feels preachy and biased rather than objective and balanced.

Another issue with the film is its lack of focus, as it tries to cover too many events and themes in a short amount of time. The film jumps back and forth between various time periods and events in Cheney's career, and it often feels scattered and disjointed as a result. This lack of focus makes it difficult for the viewer to follow the story and keep track of the various characters and events, and it detracts from rather than enhances the film's impact. In addition to its heavy-handed tone and lack of focus, Vice is also hampered by its overly stylized and flashy filmmaking. The film employs a number of unconventional techniques, such as breaking the fourth wall, using animation and special effects, and incorporating musical numbers, in an attempt to make it more entertaining and engaging. While these techniques can be effective in small doses, they often feel forced and distracting in the context of the film, and they distract from rather than enhance the story.

Despite these flaws, Vice is still a film that is worth watching for its strong acting and historical context. Christian Bale's performance as Dick Cheney is a highlight of the film, and the film's portrayal of the various political and historical events that shaped Cheney's career is engaging and informative. The film's heavy-handed and preachy tone and lack of focus are issues that detract from rather than enhance the film, but they do not completely undermine its impact. Similarly, the film's overly stylized and flashy filmmaking can be distracting, but it does not completely ruin the film.

Overall, I would give Vice a rating of 3 out of 5 stars. It is a film that is worth watching for its strong acting and historical context, but it is ultimately flawed in its execution. Its heavy-handed and preachy tone, lack of focus, and overly stylized filmmaking detract from rather than enhance the story. If you are a fan of political dramas or historical films, I would recommend giving Vice a watch, but be prepared for its flaws and inconsistency.
